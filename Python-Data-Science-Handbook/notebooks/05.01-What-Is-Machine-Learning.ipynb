    "\"Learning\" enters the fray when we give these models *tunable parameters* that can be adapted to observed data; in this way the program can be considered to be \"learning\" from the data.\n",
    "Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data.\n",
    "I'll leave to the reader the more philosophical digression regarding the extent to which this type of mathematical, model-based \"learning\" is similar to the \"learning\" exhibited by the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "机器学习基本上就是关于构建数学模型来帮助我们理解数据。当我们为这些模型提供了*可调整的参数*时，“学习”能让我们从观察到的数据中调整这些参数。也就是说，这个过程可以被认为我们从数据中“学习”。一旦这些模型已经适应（拟合）了观察到的数据之后，它们就可以用来预测和理解新的数据。作者把这个问题的哲学思考留给读者，基于模型的“学习”确实与人脑展示的“学习”类似。\n",
